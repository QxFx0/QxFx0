# QxFx0 Operator Notes

- Decision and response generation are local-first and deterministic.
- Runtime recovery is represented via local recovery trace fields (`trcLocalRecoveryPolicy`, `trcRecoveryCause`, `trcRecoveryStrategy`, `trcRecoveryEvidence`).
- Verification/release gates must keep replay envelope fields aligned with runtime contracts.
